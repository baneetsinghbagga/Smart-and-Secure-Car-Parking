# Smart-and-Secure-Car-Parking
This application makes the car parking system more secure using image processing for extracting the vehicle number from the number plate.

There are three modules in this application:
1. Car Slot occupation detection using IR Sensors and Arduino.
2. Vehicle Plate Number extraction from live images of vehicles using ML and slot allocation.
3. A NodeJS server for storing slotwise data and retrieve slot information on request.
